# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

Good day Louise.  The following report will identify key findings of the attached spreadsheet titled "Kickstarter_Challenge".  In this spreadsheet, the data has been cleaned up and and filtered to allow you to see the most importand information to you as soon as you open it, that being how other plays similar to your sfaired in their kickstarter campaigns.  At any time, you are able to clear the filters created and see all of the kickstarter data.

**Data Results**

As for creating the provided spreadsheet, there weren't to many complications.  The spreadsheet was already structured in a way that was easily readable and filterable.  I did have to add some columns(P-T) in order to provide more fidelity on the kicstarter campaigns which I think you'll appreciate.  Of specifc importance were the 'Date Created' and 'Date Ended Conversion' which allowed me to provide the table below:

What this line graph shows are campaigns that started in the early summer did better than those that started at any other time of the year.  It also showed that during the winter months, less people were inclined to donate to kickstarters.  This makes since given the holiday season and most people are spending extra on gifts for the holidays.
